# Function

- python provides serveral built-in function like `print()`,`input()`, but we can write our own function

-  A function is like `a mini program within a program`.


```
def hello():
	print("Hello World")
	print("Hello from python")



hello()
hello()
```

- the major purpose of function is to group code that get executed multiple times.

- In general, you always want to avoid duplicating code, because if you ever decide to update the code—if, for example, you find a bug you need to fix—you’ll have to remember to change the code everywhere you copied it.


## Arguments

- if `print()` or `len()` function is called,you need to pass in values and is called arguments,by typing them between parentheses

- we can define own argument to function 

```
def hello(name):
	print("Hello "+ name)

hello('Bob')

```

## Function with multi-argument

```
def hello(name,age):
	print("Hello "+name+" Your age is "+ str(age))

hello('Bob',20)

```

## Return Value and return Statement


- THe value of a function call evaluates to is called the return value of the function

```
def add(number1,number2):
	return number1+number2

add(3,5)
```
