# Modules

- Python also comes with a set of modules called the standard library. 

-  For example, the math module has mathematics-related functions, the random module has random numberâ€“related functions, and so on


```
import random
for i in rage(5):
	print(random.randint(1,10))
```

## `from module import somthing`

```
from random import *
for i in range(5):
	print(randint(1,10))
```

## `import module_name as alias`
